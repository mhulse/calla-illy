# Calla-illy

![Demo pic](demo.png)

Print-optimzed months-in-year calendar to assist workplace productivity.

Intended to be laminated (with dry-erase laminate) and hung in workplace for folks to mark important dates and make notes in gutter space.

Alternatively, one could skip laminating and just draw on print directly (thus, saving $$$).

## Illustrator

The months in the main Illustrator file (`calla-illy.ai`) are setup up using the Area Type tool.

When altering dates with the type tool, <kbd>CMD</kbd> `+` <kbd>A</kbd> and start typing; use the <kbd>return</kbd> key to jump from box to box.

### Artboard Dimensions:

`24`" x `47.916`"

### Fonts:

The TrueType fonts used are included in the repo, though one could [download from Google directly](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto).
